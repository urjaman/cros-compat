The point is to put things in here that are helpful
for running Arch in a chroot or container under CrOS..

cras-alsa is the PKGBUILD for the ALSA plugins for using the ChromeOS Audio Server (CRAS)
(Mostly shamelessly ripped from crouton audio target.)

mpv 0.27 (mpv027) still has the -vo wayland backend
that works nicely (without OpenGL inside the container) with CrOS
